Hi, I’m working on converting my Replit web app (https://bias23.replit.app) into an Android APK using Cordova via Volt Builder.
The app itself loads perfectly — internal navigation works fine — but external links (like TikTok and ChatGPT) don’t open at all when clicked inside the WebView.

I already tried full permission setup inside config.xml, like this:

<access origin="*" />
<allow-navigation href="*" />
<allow-intent href="*" />
<plugin name="cordova-plugin-inappbrowser" source="npm" />


I also tried adding window.open() interception logic inside index.html, but links like:

https://www.tiktok.com

https://chat.openai.com

still remain blocked or ignored silently in the Android WebView.

⚙️ Goal I want to achieve:

When a user clicks any external link (not under bias23.replit.app), the app should automatically open it via:

cordova.InAppBrowser.open(url, '_system', 'location=yes');


Internal links from my web app (still under the same domain) should continue opening normally inside the embedded WebView / iframe.

The behavior should be stable on Android 12+, which uses the new SplashScreen API and stricter WebView sandbox policies.

⚡ Context of my setup:

App is built with Volt Builder (Cordova 12 base).

Main webview loads my site using an <iframe> like this:

<iframe src="https://bias23.replit.app"
  allow="camera;microphone;fullscreen;clipboard-read;clipboard-write;geolocation"
  sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-popups allow-modals"></iframe>


Everything inside bias23.replit.app works well, but external navigation is blocked (even after allowing popups).

🔍 My understanding:
This issue might come from Android WebView’s shouldOverrideUrlLoading() policy or from domain-level CSP (X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN) on TikTok/ChatGPT.
If that’s true, I just need a working JavaScript interceptor or Cordova plugin setup that:

Detects outbound URLs,

Uses InAppBrowser or _system intent to open them externally,

Works in both iframe and main WebView modes.

✅ Please provide:

A working JavaScript snippet to inject (inside deviceready event).

A confirmed example of how to intercept external navigation correctly in Cordova 12+.

If this is blocked permanently by Android’s new WebView security, suggest the recommended approach (e.g., native shouldOverrideUrlLoading in MainActivity or AndroidManifest intent filters).

My goal is simple: I want the app to open TikTok and ChatGPT links externally (in browser or their native app), while keeping my internal Replit app fully functional inside the Cordova WebView.
