YOU ARE A REPLIT CODING AGENT (RERE).

READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE DOING ANYTHING.

PROJECT NAME:
BIAS23 Pro – Behavioral Intelligence Audit System

PROJECT STATUS:
- The system is ALREADY WORKING.
- Features are COMPLETE and FUNCTIONAL.
- The current architecture, routing, API calls, state management, and logic MUST NOT be changed.

YOUR TASK IS NOT TO BUILD NEW FEATURES.
YOUR TASK IS TO CLARIFY POSITIONING, UX GUIDANCE, AND TRUST SIGNALS
WITHOUT TOUCHING CORE LOGIC.

====================================================
ABSOLUTE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
====================================================

DO NOT:
- Change folder structure
- Change routing
- Change API endpoints
- Change analysis logic
- Change AI prompts or inference logic
- Remove any existing feature
- Add new heavy dependencies
- Refactor backend logic
- Rewrite components unnecessarily

YOU MAY ONLY:
- Adjust UI text (copywriting)
- Add small reusable UI components (stateless)
- Add visual guidance sections
- Add disclaimer / integrity notices
- Add labels, subtitles, or helper text
- Make LIGHT layout additions that do not affect behavior

====================================================
PRIMARY GOAL
====================================================

Make it CLEAR that BIAS23 is:

1) A BEHAVIORAL AUDIT & RISK MITIGATION SYSTEM
2) NOT an SMM Panel
3) NOT a follower / views / engagement boosting service
4) A tool for SAFE, EDUCATED, and SUSTAINABLE growth

The system should feel like:
- A diagnostic & decision-support tool
NOT
- An instant growth or “magic” AI tool

====================================================
TASK 1 — PRODUCT POSITIONING (UI COPY ONLY)
====================================================

LOCATION: HOME / DASHBOARD LANDING

Replace or update the MAIN HEADLINE TEXT (UI text only).

MAIN HEADLINE:
“Behavioral Risk Audit & Coaching System for TikTok”

SUBHEADLINE:
“Audit before growth. Detect risks, avoid false engagement, and improve content behavior safely.”

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT remove existing components.
- Only replace the main headline and subheadline text.

====================================================
TASK 2 — INTEGRITY / DISCLAIMER COMPONENT
====================================================

Create ONE reusable UI component.
Example name (you may choose similar):
- IntegrityNotice
- TrustNotice
- RiskDisclosure

This component must be:
- Stateless
- Pure UI
- Reusable
- No logic
- No API calls

CONTENT (USE EXACT TEXT BELOW):

⚠️ Integrity Notice  
BIAS23 does NOT provide services to increase followers, views, likes, or artificial engagement.  
This system is designed for behavioral auditing, education, and algorithmic risk mitigation  
to support safe and sustainable account growth.

====================================================
WHERE TO DISPLAY THIS COMPONENT
====================================================

Render this component in the following pages:

1) Home / Dashboard landing
2) TikTok Pro → Analytics / Analysis pages
3) Marketing Pro → Analysis pages

DO NOT:
- Block user actions
- Add modals
- Add confirmations

This is an INFORMATIONAL NOTICE ONLY.

====================================================
TASK 3 — “START HERE” GUIDED SECTION (STATIC)
====================================================

LOCATION: HOME / DASHBOARD

Add a simple static section titled:

“Start Here”

CONTENT (visual guide only, no logic):

1. Run an account or video audit first  
2. Review insights and detected risks  
3. Use AI Mentor to refine strategy and execution

IMPORTANT:
- This is NOT a wizard.
- This is NOT conditional.
- This is NOT interactive logic.
- This is ONLY visual onboarding guidance.

====================================================
TASK 4 — TRUST LAYER (NON-FUNCTIONAL LABEL)
====================================================

LOCATION: ANALYSIS RESULTS (account, video, batch)

Add a small UI label or badge near analysis output:

Example text:
- “AI-Generated Insight”
or
- “AI Insight (Confidence: Medium–High)”

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT calculate confidence
- DO NOT add scoring logic
- This is a STATIC TRUST INDICATOR ONLY

====================================================
TASK 5 — MENU & SECTION CLARITY (TEXT ONLY)
====================================================

DO NOT change routing.

You MAY add small subtitles or helper text.

Example:
- “Analytics” → subtitle: “Audit & Risk Insights”
- “AI Mentor” → subtitle: “Guided improvement after audit”

====================================================
QUALITY CHECK BEFORE FINISHING
====================================================

Before you consider the task done, VERIFY:

- All existing features still work
- No errors in build
- No logic was modified
- No routing changed
- No API calls altered
- Changes are UI-level only
- The system clearly communicates:
  “Audit first, then grow — not instant results”

====================================================
FINAL NOTE
====================================================

This project will be expanded in future phases.
Your role now is CLARITY and TRUST, NOT EXPANSION.

If something requires changing logic or structure,
DO NOT do it.
STOP and report instead.

END OF INSTRUCTIONS.
